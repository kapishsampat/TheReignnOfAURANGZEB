 <font size="7">.</font>Aurangzeb maintained the empire for nearly half a century and in fact extended it in the south as far as Tanjore (now Thanjavur) and Trichinopoly (now Tiruchchirappalli)<br>
 <font size="7">.</font>The failure of the Mughals to cope with them after the reign of his son Bahādur Shāh I led to the collapse of the empire in the mid-18th century.<br>
 <font size="7">.</font>The Tomb of Aurangzeb, the last influential Mughal emperor, is located in Khuldabad, Aurangabad district, Maharashtra, India<br>
 <font size="7">.</font>The first overt sign of change was the reimposition of the jizya, or poll tax, on non-Muslims in 1679 (a tax that had been abolished by Akbar). This in turn was followed by a Rajput revolt in 1680–81, supported by Aurangzebs third son, Akbar. Hindus still served the empire, but no longer with enthusiasm<br>
<font size="7">.</font>Aurangzeb had different names and spellings- Aurangzeb, also spelled Aurangzib, Arabic Awrangzīb, kingly title ʿĀlamgīr, original name Muḥī al-Dīn Muḥammad<br>
